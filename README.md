## Hi, are you all right? 👋

### who i am?
  🏫 - Information systems student at Federal University at Ceará 
  
  🧑🏼‍💻 -  Currently learning web backend technologies and make projects (yes! i'll be web developer! 😋)
  
  🕵️‍♂️ - I love to learn new things, so I consider myself as a detective (HAHAHAHAHA!  😅 😂 ), because I always try to go deeper (especially when it comes to web development <3)
  
  😣 - I'm a shy person, but I'm try to get more involved with other people. I'm improving in this regard 😎
  
### My favorite technologies
  
  - Node js ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
  - Express 
  - Nestjs
  - MongoDb to NOSQL database
  - Postgress to SQL database
  - Day after day, I'm specializing in them. My dream is to become an expert on the javascript back-end stack
